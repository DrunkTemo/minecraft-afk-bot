# minecraft-afk-bot
afk minecwaft bot for any goals (for example, to keep your aternyos serverah always on). includes antiafk actions, and forked from @H2N-DEV on replit.com, who forked from @YoutubeTutorial ~ . ~

## how to use
1. go to replit.com and click make a new app
2. upload pwoject files
3. go to settings.json and change:
- "username": "BOT_NAME_HERE" (enter any name for your bot for ingame name instead of BOT_NAME_HERE)
- "ip": "something.aternos.me" (your serverah ip instead of something.aternos.me, where you need to join your bot)
- "port": 25565 (server port, syometimes it may be default 25565)
- "version": "1.19.3" (the native version of the server where you need to join byot. and nyo, viaversion wont work, and you can use only ~1.12.2 - 1.19.3 right nyow)
4. run bot
