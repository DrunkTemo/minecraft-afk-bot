# minecraft-afk-bot
afk minecwaft bot for any goals (for example, to keep yourrr aternyos serverah always on). includes antiafk actions, and forked from @H2N-DEV on replit.com, who forked from @YoutubeTutorial ~ . ~

## how to use
1. go to replit.com and click make a new app
2. upload pwoject files
3. go to settings.json and change:
- "username": "BOT_NAME_HERE" (enter any name for your bot for ingame name instead of BOT_NAME_HERE)
- "ip": "something.aternos.me" (your serverah ip instead of something.aternos.me where you need to join your bot)
- "port": 25565 (server port, syometimes it may be default 25565)
- "version": "1.19.3" (the native version of the server where you need to join byot. and nyo, viafabric wont work, and you can use only ~1.12.2 - 1.19.3 right nyow)
4. run bot
5. copy bot uptime link, and paste it in any uptime site
thats all...

im not recommend to touch any other settings, and also dont chat anything on your server, or bot will crash themselves uhh
